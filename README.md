## Building

This sample is forked from webgpu-samples and uses the same build system
(TypeScript+Rollup via Node).

- Install dependencies: `npm ci`.
- For development, start the dev server which will watch and recompile
  sources: `npm start`. You can navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the project.
- For production, compile the project: `npm run build`.
- To run a production server to serve the built assets, do `npm run serve`.
